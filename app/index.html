				<p>In 1958, English pictorial photographer Henry Peach Robinson created the world&rsquo;s first photomontage by combining five different negatives to make one complete print of a young girl on her deathbed. &ldquo;Fading Away&rdquo;—Robinson&rsquo;s first and most famous composite photo—depicts a young girl dying of consumption and was controversial when it was exhibited, with many believing it was not a suitable subject for photography.</p>

				<h1>Overflow</h1>
				<p>On the night of Aug 8, 1975, a line of people frantically piled sandbags atop Henan Province&rsquo;s <b>Banqiao Dam</b> while being battered by the worst storm ever recorded in the region. They were in a race with the rapidly rising Ru River to save the dam and the millions of people that lay sleeping downstream. It was a race they were about to lose.</p>
				<p>Just after 1:00 am, the sky cleared and stars emerged from behind the storm clouds. There was an eerie calm as someone yelled, &ldquo;The water level is going down! The flood is retreating!&rdquo;</p>
				<p>There was little chance to enjoy that calm. One survivor recalled that a few seconds later it &ldquo;sounded like the sky was collapsing and the earth was cracking.&rdquo; The equivalent of 280,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools burst through the crumbling dam, taking with it entire towns and as many as 171,000 lives.</p>
